# Happy Birthday Jacob! - Python Style

This is a simple, code-themed birthday message for Jacob's 27th birthday, written in a Python-esque style.

## What it is

This "program" defines a function `wish_jacob_happy_birthday` that takes the birthday person's age and name as input. It then constructs and returns a formatted birthday message that includes:

* A title indicating the celebration.
* A simulated "initialization" and a loop representing each year of Jacob's life, symbolically sending "joyful bytes."
* A prominent "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" message with Jacob's name.
* A concluding wish for a year filled with positivity and bug-free experiences (a nod to the coding theme).

When the script is executed, it calls this function with Jacob's age (27) and name ("Jacob") and prints the resulting birthday message to the console.

## How to "Run" (Conceptual)

While this isn't actual executable Python code that performs actions beyond printing text, you can imagine running it in a Python interpreter. The output would be the birthday message itself.

1.  Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `birthday_jacob.py`).
2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
4.  Run the command: `python birthday_jacob.py`

The terminal would then display the birthday message.

## How to Share with Jacob

You can share this message with Jacob in a few ways:

* **Directly as text:** Copy and paste the code block and send it to him. The formatting will convey the code-like style.
* **As a text file:** Save the code as a `.txt` file and send him the file.
* **As a Markdown file:** Save it as a `.md` file (like this one) so he sees the formatted code blocks.
* **Screenshot:** Take a screenshot of the code in a text editor for a visual representation.

## Customization

You can easily adapt this for future birthdays or other people:

* **Age:** Change the first argument passed to the `wish_jacob_happy_birthday` function.
* **Name:** Change the second argument passed to the function.
* **Message:** Modify the strings within the `message` variable to add a more personal touch.

Happy Birthday, Jacob! Hope you have a fantastic 27th year!
